This is a work in progress research project made in Binghamton's Research Immersion Program. It is an AI prediction program used to predict the percent chance that the person of a certain race would get their housing loan approved or not based on previous data. The goal of our project is to create a housing AI that will fairly, without bias, tell whether someone should have thier housing loan approved.
